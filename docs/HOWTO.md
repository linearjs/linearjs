# How to use Linearwiki: a beginner's guide

## Basic syntax

When you have a \| at the beginning of a tag, it will mark the beginning
of that element. If the \| is at the end, it's th end of the element.

## Tag names/main documentation

### Headings

#### Heading 1 to 6
##### `|# :: #|, |1 :: 1|` :: components.elements.h(1:6).linear
Is equal to a simple `<hX>` tag.
Change the integer in place of the `1` to the desired size, e.g. `3` for `<h3>`.
Works pretty much the same with the `#`, except you repeat the hashtag `x` times, where `x` is the size, e.g. `###` for `<h3>`.
